# Learning From Images and Signals

## Introduction
This repository contains implementations for Theory and Application of images and signals, including: 
- Image Inpainting: When an image has missing sections, we can attempt to fill in those in such a ways as to at least make the image plausible. 
- Nyquist and signals from samples: How sampling at a a rate that equals or exceeds the highest frequency in the signal ensures that we can recover the signal from the samples.
- Finding signals in noise: Using the the non-local means method to denoise the image by smoothing the it, but preserves edges and small details.
